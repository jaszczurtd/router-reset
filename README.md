ðŸ”Œ Small Router Reseter

A minimalistic watchdog-style project designed to automatically restart a router when Internet connectivity is lost.

Built using a Raspberry Pi Pico W, the Earlephilhower Arduino core, and standard Arduino libraries. The device monitors Internet availability (via ICMP ping) and toggles a relay to power-cycle the router if the connection fails for a specified period.

Ideal for home networks experiencing unstable Internet where a physical restart of the router often solves the issue.
